# Elementary OS Settings, Apps and More

Here you can find some useful stuff I use for Elementary OS.

* Disk partition when installing OS.   
* Apps and the way to install them.   
* Customizations.   
* Useful sources and more.

| ⚠️ Mind that all of these are my personal choice. Some of them, you might not need, some of them would be useless for you at all. |
